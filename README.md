## Biometrics and Environment Applications

This repository contains the development of a project focused on capturing biometric and environmental information using a small sensor. The system is programmed using Arduino (C++) and includes an analysis of the collected information from surrounding gases to create a map displaying contaminated areas. The map is showcased in an Android application developed using Android Studio (Java).

## Project Overview
The project revolves around the implementation of applications and systems aimed at capturing biometric and environmental information. The hardware development platforms used are based on general-purpose embedded systems, allowing them to be programmed and controlled using open-source software platforms on a personal computer. These general-purpose platforms are supplemented with specific embedded systems that incorporate sensors and electronic stages for capturing biometric information. Specific embedded systems are also employed for capturing, processing, and manipulating environmental information such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, gas detection, etc.

## Key Features
- Development of a biometric and environmental information capturing system using a small sensor programmed in Arduino (C++).
- Analysis of information collected from surrounding gases to create a map displaying contaminated areas.
- Creation of an Android application using Android Studio (Java) to showcase the contaminated areas map.
- Utilization of general-purpose embedded systems for software programming and control.
- Integration of specific embedded systems with sensors for capturing various types of biometric information.
- Incorporation of electronic stages to process and manipulate biometric data.
- Utilization of open-source software platforms for programming and controlling the embedded systems.

## Methodology and Evaluation
The project follows a combined approach of CDIO and Scrum methodologies to ensure comprehensive engineering education and effective project management. The CDIO methodology provides a holistic framework for the project, guiding the development process from conception to operation. Then, the Scrum methodology has been adopted for project management, incorporating sprint planning, task management, and iterative development.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the development environment with Arduino and Android Studio.
3. Install any required dependencies and libraries specified in the documentation.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to express our gratitude to the course instructors and the university for providing the opportunity to work on this project and gain practical experience in implementing biometric and environmental applications.
